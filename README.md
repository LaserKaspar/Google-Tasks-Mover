# Google Tasks - Mover

A tool to move your google tasks between lists in bulk. Due to API limitations it is really slow ~1 Task / Second.

## My Usecase

The default list for Google Assistant can not be changed, so I needed to swap two of my lists in order for Google Assistent to add the Tasks to the correct list.
